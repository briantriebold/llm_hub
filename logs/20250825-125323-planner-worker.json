Each post should be 280 characters max and include a CTA to join the mailing list. Let me start by breaking down the requirements.\n\nFirst, what's the goal? It's to introduce the institute via three posts. Each post must be concise, under 280 chars, and end with a call-to-action (CTA) encouraging people to join the mailing list. The user is Human, no paid APIs, local runtime, small model, and needs past-ready output.\n\nSo each of the three posts should cover different aspects but all promote joining the mailing list. Maybe the first post introduces the institute, second highlights an offering or value proposition, third CTA again. Or perhaps a series that builds interest over multiple steps leading to the CTA.\n\nWait, the user said \"3-post social intro\" so maybe each post is part of a sequence. Let's think about common social media strategies: teaser posts, informative, then CTA. But all need to funnel towards joining the mailing list.\n\nEach character counts, so I have to be precise. Each numbered step must start with the number and a hyphen, like 1.-, 2.- etc. The total for each post can't exceed 280 characters. Need to include the institute's name, what's it about? Maybe Triebold Institute is related to AI or tech given the context of an AI planner. But without specific info, perhaps it's a general academic/tech institute.\n\nAssume Triebold Institute is in STEM fields. The CTA should be clear: \"Join our mailing list\" or something like that. Need to make sure each post ends with the CTA and stays within character limit.\n\nFirst Post Idea: Introduction to the institute's mission or field. Second could highlight a specific aspect, like research, events, etc. Third might offer an incentive for joining, like exclusive content, early access, etc., followed by the CTA.\n\nCheck character count per line. Let's draft:\n\n1.- Welcome to Triebold Institute, pioneers in [Field]. Dive into innovation & discovery. ðŸ§ ðŸš€\n\n2.- Explore our research, events, & community. Join our mailing list for insider updates! #Triebold #AI\n\n3.- Get exclusive content + Q&A with experts. Sign up now: [Link] âž”\n\nWait, but the CTA needs to be part of each post? Or only in one?
